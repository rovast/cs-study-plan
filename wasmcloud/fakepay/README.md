# wasmCloud example capability provider: Fakepay

This is a stub for a simple [payments capability provider](https://wasmcloud-dev/app-dev/create-provider/rust/)
used in the [Application development](https://wasmcloud.dev/app-dev/) tutorial.

The stub conforms to the [Payments interface
definition](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/blob/main/interface/payments/payments.smithy),
and compiles, but does not contain implementations of its methods.
